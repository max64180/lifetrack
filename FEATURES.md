# Feature List (LifeTrack)

Last updated: 2026-02-08

## Backlog
- Show a smart suggestion/banner to enable the "❔ Da stimare" filter when there are missing estimates. (Requested)
- Automated QA test system: Unit + Component + E2E (Playwright), optional visual regression; run locally and in GitHub Actions before deploy. (Requested)
- PDF export: detailed deadlines list (for full overview/export use cases). Keep data model/exportability in mind. (Requested)
- Budget card simplification exploration:
  - Focus on total only (total + count, thinner bar, small urgent badge)
  - Split total vs urgent count (no category strip)
  - Show dominant category only (total + tiny category hint)
- "Spese superflue" management (labels/filters/budget impact). (Requested)
